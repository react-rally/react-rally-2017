The second is a bespoke, Hacker News masterpiece. But it demands regular rewrites and requires constant re-education.\nWhich do you chose?\nMaybe you already chose a path. Your fingers are bleeding from all the typing or you're in the middle of re-write #3.\nHow do you get off that path?\nLet's talk about getting back to React, the overlooked APIs and uncommon patterns that make you a happier and healthier React developer."

In this session geared towards those familiar with React, let‚Äôs learn about what React Fiber is and why it exists through the lens of how it will impact your React development and the performance of your apps at runtime."

Can we do more than imagine it? On the modern web, we can! Using React and WebGazer.js (an open-source eye-tracking library for the web), we can approximate this communication technique, the method that Jean-Dominique Bauby used to compose his best-selling memoir The Diving Bell and the Butterfly."

This gentle intro to an otherwise confusing comp-sci topic will take your React user interfaces to the next level."
